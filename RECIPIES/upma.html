        The upma recipe I share here is adapted from my momâ€™s recipe and continues to be a favorite in my home. The ingredients used to flavor the rava give it a deliciously satisfying taste that will make this dish one of your new favorite go-to breakfasts.
    </p>

    <h1>What is Rava Upma ?</h1>
    <p>Upma is a flavorful South Indian breakfast dish made from rava or cream of wheat.


        This traditional dish involves cooking roasted rava in water that has been flavored by ghee (or oil), cashews, urad dal (lentils), chana dal (husked chickpeas), onion, ginger and additional herbs and spices. Sugar can be added for a mildly sweet and savory dish.
        
        <p>This steaming hot breakfast dish can be made vegan by using oil instead of ghee. Full of warmth, flavor and deliciousness, this upma tastes so good. So why not take a break from that boring oatmeal and try something new? You canâ€™t lose!
        </p>
        <p>
        The main ingredient in any upma recipe is rava. Also called â€˜sujiâ€˜ in Hindi and â€˜cream of wheatâ€™ or â€˜semolinaâ€™ in English, it is simply granulated wheat.
        </p>
        <p>
        What really makes an upma breakfast dish special are all the fried ingredients that are used for tempering. These ingredients can vary depending on the recipe, but usually include some sweet, savory and nutty flavors.</p>


        <h1>How To Make Upma</h1>

        <p>Preparation and roasting ravs</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Prep the ingredients first. Take 1 cup rava (fine variety), â…“ cup finely chopped onions, 1 teaspoon chopped green chillies, 1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger and 2 tablespoons coriander leaves (cilantro). Also take 8 to 10 curry leaves, 10 to 12 cashews, 1 teaspoon chana dal and 1 teaspoon urad dal.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Heat a pan or kadai first. Add 1 cup rava or cream of wheat (fine variety).</p>
                <img src="step2.jpeg">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Begin to roast the rava. Stir often while roasting the rava.

            </li>
            
            <li>
                <p>The rava or sooji grains should become fragrant and start to look dry, separate and crisp. Donâ€™t brown the rava.

                </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Once the rava becomes fragrant and starts to look dry and crisp, switch off the flame and put the roasted rava on a plate and set aside.

            <h3>Frying and Sauteing</h3>
            <li>
                <p>
                    In a pan, heat 2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) or oil. You could use sunflower oil or peanut oil or safflower oil or any neutral tasting oil
                </p>
                <img src="step6.jpeg">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Lower the heat. Add 1 teaspoon mustard seeds. When you hear the crackling sound of mustard seeds, it means they are getting fried.
                </p>
                <img src="step7.jpeg">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Now add the Â½ teaspoon cumin seeds along with 1 teaspoon chana dal (husked and split bengal gram) and 1 teaspoon urad dal (husked and split black gram).</p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Immediately add 10 to 12 cashews and begin to fry on a low to medium-low heat.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    By the time the cashews get golden the dals should also be golden.

            <h2>Boiling Water</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p>Then add 2.5 cups water to this mixture.
                    </p>
                    <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/upma-recipe16.jpg">

                
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add salt as required. Mix well and check the taste of water. It should be a bit salty but not too much. In case if the salt becomes less in the dish, you can always sprinkle some salt from the top when eating.
                    </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Then add 1 teaspoon sugar. Sugar is optional and you can skip it. We prefer a slight sweet taste in the upma and hence we add it.

            <h2>Making Upma</h2>
            <li>
                <p>
                    When the water comes to a rolling boil, lower the flame to its lowest. Then add the rava in 4 to 5 batches with a spoon.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Once you add the first batch of rava, stir and mix immediately so that the roasted rava gets mixed evenly with the water.

            <li>
                <p>Then add the next batch of rava. Mix and stir again very well ensuring that the batch of rava is mixed evenly in water.</p>

            <li>

                    Continue to add and stir the rava up to the last batch.

            <li>
                <p> Quickly stir and mix very well. The rava grains will absorb water, swell and get cooked.

            <li>
                <p>Cover and allow the rava upma to steam for 2 to 3 minutes on a low heat.

            <li>
                <p>Then switch off the heat. In the below photo, the rava is cooked well and the upma is ready.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Lastly add about 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves (cilantro). You can add more coriander leaves if you like.  
                </p>

                <p>Mix again.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Serve upma hot with slices of lemon. I also sprinkle some sev (fried gram flour vermicelli) on upma while serving. Though this is not the way upma is traditionally served, the folks at home prefer this Mumbai style. You can also serve it with coconut chutney or lemon pickle or idli podi.
